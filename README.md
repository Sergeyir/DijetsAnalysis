# Overview

This is a simple project that helps to study dijets in high-energy p+p collisions. It compares $d \sigma/dp_{T}$ for single jets and $d \sigma / d \Delta y$ for dijets for pdf set NNPDF31_lo_as_0118 in pythia8 generation with and without hadronization and radiation + fastjet3 reconstruction algorithm and basic computation. The realisation of comutation and generation is implemented with c++.

Using $d \sigma / dy_{1} dy_{2} dp^2_{T}$ from [Michelangelo L. Mangano "Introduction to QCD"](https://cds.cern.ch/record/454171/files/p53.pdf) (Eq.205) the following formula was obtained

```math
\frac{d \sigma}{dp_T dy_1 dy_2} = \frac{8 \pi p_T}{s} \sum_{ijkl} f_{ij}(x_{1}, \mu^2) f_{ij}(x_{2}, \mu^2) \frac{d \sigma_{ij \rightarrow kl}}{d \Omega}
```

The summation is performed by the simplest processes ($q$ is for quark, $g$ is for gluon):
- $q + q' \rightarrow q + q'$
- $q + q \rightarrow q + q$
- $q + \bar{q} \rightarrow q + \bar{q}$
- $q + \bar{q} \rightarrow q + '\bar{q}'$
- $q + \bar{q} \rightarrow g + g$
- $g+g \rightarrow q + \bar{q}$
- $g+q \rightarrow g + q$
- $g+g \rightarrow g + g$

You can find $d \sigma_{ij \rightarrow kl}/d \Omega$ in [PDG report](https://pdg.lbl.gov/2023/reviews/contents_sports.html) (Eq. 51.4 - 51.12)

The final formulas for the cross sections are
```math
\frac{d \sigma}{dp_T} = \int dy_1 \int dy_2 \frac{d \sigma}{dp_T dy_1 dy_2}
```

```math
\frac{d \sigma}{d \Delta y} = \int dp_T \int dy_1 \int dy_2 \frac{d \sigma}{dp_T dy_1 dy_2} \delta(\Delta y - |y_1 - y_2|)
```

# Requirements

- GNU GCC wiht C++17 or newer
- [ROOT](https://root.cern/) + compilation with python3
- [LHAPDF6](https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/) + pdf set NNPDF31_lo_as_0118 installed
- [PYTHIA8](https://pythia.org/) + compilation with LHAPDF6
- [FASTJET3](https://fastjet.fr/) 

# Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sergeyir/DijetsAnalysis
```

# Usage

First define paths `$PYTHIA`, `$FASTJET`, `$ROOT`, and `$LHAPDF` in your .bashrc file to the packages directories that they were compiled into. Also check `${LHAPDF6}/../src` - part of `$LHAPDF6_LIB` variable in Makefile.inc since the directories can mismatch.

There are 2 programs you can run: generate.cpp and analytic.cpp. First calculates the cross sections in pythia8 with fastjet3 algorithm and writes the output file. Second calculates the cross section by implementing monte-carlo integration and also writes the output file. You need to run them first to get the data you then can draw.

Frist make both programs
```sh
make analytic generate
```

Then you can launch pythia8+fastjet3 computation by typing
```sh
./generate.exe setup_name
```

For setup_name pass a name of a .cmnd file located in input directory without an extension. There are 2 files already presented in the input directory:
- setup1 - for calculation of cross sections with normal pythia8 setup.
- setup2 - for calculation of cross sections without hadronization and without initial and final state radiation
These files also contain important information for generation: energy, pdf set, pTHatMin, number of events to generate, $\Delta y_{max}$, and fastjet R parameter.

And you also can launch the analytic computation of the cross section by typing
```sh
./analytic.exe
```

After generating the data you can draw the result by running
```sh
python draw.py
```
