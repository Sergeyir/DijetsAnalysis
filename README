# Overview

This is a simple project that helps to study dijets in high-energy p+p collisions. It compares $d \sigma / d p_T`$ for single jets and $d \sigma / d \Delta y`$ for dijets for pdf set NNPDF31_lo_as_0118 in pythia8 generation with and without hadronization and radiation + fastjet3 reconstruction algorithm and basic computation. The realisation of comutation and generation is implemented with c++.

Using $d \sigma / dy1 dy2 dp^2_T`$ (https://cds.cern.ch/record/454171/files/p53.pdf, Eq.205) the following formula was obtained

```math
\frac{d \sigma}{dp^2T dy1 dy2} = \frac{8 \pi p_T}{s} \sum_{ijkl} f_{ij}(x_{1}, \mu^2) f_{ij}(x_{2}, \mu^2) \frac{d \sigma_{ij->kl}}{d \Omega}
```
